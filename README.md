Introduction to generative art using p5js &amp; javascript

This workshop introduces the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking and generative computer imaging. Participants can learn how to make artworks and creative visualizations using data, code, and interaction. Since there is an increasing overlap between cultural and human fields with technological and engineering domains among dynamically evolving networked communities, new kinds of languages are emerging that require both analytical and logical thinking as well as intuitive and proactive approaches from creators.

## tools

We are using the free and open source [p5js](https://p5js.org/) library to create shapes and forms on the canvas, in Javascript language. The simplest way to get started is to use the excellent [online p5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), however if you plan to bring your pieces offline and continue working on them in a more elaborative way, it is useful to clone this repository and use the open source, cross platform editor [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) with your projects.
