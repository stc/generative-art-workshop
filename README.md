# generative-art-workshop
Introduction to algorithmic thinking, instruction based and generative art, using [p5js](https://p5js.org/) &amp; Javascript

This workshop introduces the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking and generative computer imaging. Participants can learn how to make artworks and creative visualizations using data, code, and interaction. Since there is an increasing overlap between cultural and human fields with technological and engineering domains among dynamically evolving networked communities, new kinds of languages are emerging that require both analytical and logical thinking as well as intuitive and proactive approaches from creators.

Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of autonomous systems. Classic systems can be summed up as a brain and its input/output. For a system that generate art, it means that first the system needs to be fed some information and rules governing the evolution of this input. Last, it has to represent what has been generated. Very often, it relies on repetition, geometric transformations or randomness. But you can feed it any kind of value from simple noise to complex data or your own formalized systems.


## topics

### language

A convenient, beautifully written introduction on Designing Programs can be found [here](https://designingprograms.bitbucket.io/index.html). A more comprehensive guide on the JavaScript language can be found [here](https://javascript.info/) and there is a [cheatsheat](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/) that might become handy to use as a reference. Since we are using the [p5js](https://p5js.org/) library to display shapes, colors and motion in the canvas, make sure to check the [getting started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) section and explore the [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) to see the capabilities of the language modules. There are three main concepts we are covering during the intro section:

- variables: storing data
- functions: manipulate data
- events: loops, conditionals and structure

## tools

We are using the free and open source [p5js](https://p5js.org/) library to create shapes and forms on the canvas, in Javascript language. The simplest way to get started is to use the excellent [online p5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), however if you plan to bring your pieces offline and continue working on them in a more elaborative way, it is useful to clone this repository and use the open source, cross platform editor [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) with your projects.
